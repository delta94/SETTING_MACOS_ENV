# DAY 5

## Write policy

When the processor changes a data item, it iss changed in the cache. If this line of cache is replaced, main memory needs to be updated. 

### `Write through`: cache and main memory are updated at the same time whenever data is changed 

### `Write back`: main memory is updated when the cache line is replaced. ( First when you update the line in cache. The cpu don't update, and check if you write in this line again, it will update in memory).

- Line size càng lớn, cache miss càng tăng. 


### Line size 

- A cache line is the amount ò data copied into the cache at one time, 16 to 64 bytes in commo
- When there is a cache miss, a line of memory is copied into the cache 
- The bigger the line size, the fewer lines in the cache
- Big lines will copy more nearby addresses
- The relationship between block size and hit ratio is depends on the locality characteistics of a particular program 

### Number of caches 

#### Multi-level cache 
- Most systems have two or three cache levels
- Higher level caches are usually larger

#### Unified vs split caches 
- Unified cache: asingale cache used to store references to both data and instructions
-  Split caches: the cache is split into two, one dedicated
